# JavaFX to do list
Java FX GUI to do list application for uni classes

Application progress:
1. ~~Base of logic - all nodes for to do app~~
2. ~~Display tasks on the screen~~
3. ~~User controls~~
4. Code refactor
5. ~~Better look of app~~



### App overview:  
User can create new tasks, he can manage priority of them and make subtasks!  
Task creation process and adding subtasks:

Managing tasks, subtasks: - removing subtasks, uncheck tasks, move whole tasks or just some single subtasks.

Code is a bit messy, but it was my first time doing GUI in JavaFX. It was pretty neat experience, but styling via ``css`` has a lot of weird rules, and most of classic web rules just doesnt work here, which was very annoying.

Built using Maven and JavaFX.
