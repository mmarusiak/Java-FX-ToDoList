# JavaFX to do list
Java FX GUI to do list application for uni classes

Application progress:
1. ~~Base of logic - all nodes for to do app~~
2. ~~Display tasks on the screen~~
3. ~~User controls~~
4. Code refactor
5. Better look of app



For now user can create new tasks, drag them into subtasks/other sections mark them as done/unmark them - they will move to correct sections automatically!
